    description: "I was tasked to design coffee bag packaging for a coffee shop brand Baker & Spice in the UK. It seemed only natural to incorporate the coffee's origins and culture within that design through illustrations of a scene that ties in all of the country's elements in harmony. I chose iconic sceneries from each country that showcase its natural bright colours. The chosen color palette gives it that fresh and modern feel, while the silky-finish makes the packaging look luxurious.",

    description: "The brief for this project was to create a logo and brand identity for a Web developer. I designed Benjamin's logo whilst also representing his purpose as a Web developer by taking common characters from coding language and translating these into the clients initials 'B.P'. I took great emphasis on the logo and created a better connection with his role by creating a fun animation that showcases his logo first and reveals how his initials are also blended into the design. My aim was to have individuals recognise exactly what form of service Benjamin offers in a quick, succinct fashion. Crafting an image that represents his purpose in a glance allows viewers to understand and become interested much quicker.",
