The brand took a refresh effect by introducing more vibrant colours that had a strong connection with the attributes of the brand and gave that instant impression of offering an authentic Italian experience. Now the brand gives off a more playful and modern typography and identity system can be seen applied throughouty all of Sicily's collateral.

    description: "I was tasked to design coffee bag packaging for a coffee shop brand Baker & Spice in the UK. It seemed only natural to incorporate the coffee's origins and culture within that design through illustrations of a scene that ties in all of the country's elements in harmony. I chose iconic sceneries from each country that showcase its natural bright colours. The chosen color palette gives it that fresh and modern feel, while the silky-finish makes the packaging look luxurious.",

    description: "The brief for this project was to create a logo and brand identity for a Web developer. I designed Benjamin's logo whilst also representing his purpose as a Web developer by taking common characters from coding language and translating these into the clients initials 'B.P'. I took great emphasis on the logo and created a better connection with his role by creating a fun animation that showcases his logo first and reveals how his initials are also blended into the design. My aim was to have individuals recognise exactly what form of service Benjamin offers in a quick, succinct fashion. Crafting an image that represents his purpose in a glance allows viewers to understand and become interested much quicker.",

    description: "This illustration series is for a collection of notebooks. I tried to capture the mood with the color palette as much as possible where my aim was to reflect the tone for the concept 'day dreaming'. I primarily sketched all my designs but I never shy away from using the computer as a tool to manipulate and enhance my paintings to make them better. The final result is translated through digital vector art, where I seperated all elements into layers. This made it easier to copy certain elements from one drawing to another and to edit them where needed.",

I translate this through a series of illustrations of geometric figures, retro surf iconography and classic surf movements you can find in the water. Illustrating my simple life by the ocean and what it represents is an expression of what the ocean and its waves have taught me. For personal use and those of friends and family these digital drawings have been printed on products such as tote bags, t-shirts, notebooks and frames.  ",
